So,what's mlflow huh!!
MLflow is an open-source platform designed to manage the entire lifecycle of machine learning projects. It helps developers and data scientists streamline their workflows by tracking experiments, managing models, and deploying them efficiently. 

MLflow’s core components include:

MLflow Tracking: This component enables the logging and querying of machine learning experiments’ parameters, metrics, and models.It allows users to track hyperparameter configurations, and training outcomes, and compare the performance of different experiments.

MLflow Projects: This component provides a standardised format for defining machine learning projects, and facilitating team collaboration. Through MLproject files, MLflow Projects define dependencies and entry points, making it easier to reproduce and share projects.

MLflow Models: This component focuses on managing and deploying machine learning models. MLflow supports multiple model formats, allowing trained models to be saved and later loaded in different environments.

MLflow Registry: This component provides model registration and version control, helping teams manage the entire lifecycle of a model, from development and testing to deployment and updates.
